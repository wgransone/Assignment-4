    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid (1950–2016) left an indelible mark on the architectural landscape. Her striking structures grace the skylines of major metropolitan cities, while her product designs, including furniture, jewelry, lighting, and shoes, can be found in homes around the world. The boundary-pushing designer—arguably the most famous female architect of her time—received numerous prestigious awards over the course of her career, including the 2004 Pritzker Architecture Prize, the 2010 and 2011 Stirling Prize, the 2014 Design Museum Design of the Year Award for her Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center, and the 2015 RIBA Gold Medal.
